re: fclean all  # target to rebuild the entire project (completely cleans the project and recompiles it)


# how does this work?
# 1. starts with: all: ${NAME}
# 2. ${NAME} depends on ${OBJS}
# 3. uses the pattern rule to create the object file ft_printf.o from the source file ft_printf.c. (OBJS = ${SRCS:.c=.o})
# 4. runs the compiler command to create ft_printf.o (%.o: %.c ${CC} ${CCFLAGS} -c $< -o $@)
# 5. runs the ar rc command to create the archive library libftprintf.a from the object file ft_printf.o (ar rc libftprintf.a ft_printf.o)


# target == what i want to do; the name of a rule in the Makefile; examples: clean or all
# command == how to do it; the action or series of actions that are executed to achieve the target; example:
#	target: clean, no dependencies
#	clean:
#		rm -f myprogram myprogram.o main.o  # command to remove the executable and object files
# dependency is a file or a target that must be up-to-date before the target itself can be built, listed after the colon in a rule
